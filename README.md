===========

Import's EPG data from rytec and other xml data sources.

Providers should check out the .xml files in the /etc/epgimport directory for information on creating your own source.

Users need not read this, just configure it from the plugins.

Special thanks go to:

'rytec' for providing the XMLTV data

'oudeis' and 'arnoldd' for the initial plugin

'Panagiotis Malakoudis' for his tips for UTF-8

The PLi team for putting up with me

All the sat4all.com folks who contributed
